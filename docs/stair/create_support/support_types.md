- Two support types are available: solid and zigzag, both usable at the top and bottom of the stair.
- The solid support adapts automatically based on the landing configuration and corner type, ensuring a clean connection and structural continuity in various design conditions.
- A 2D unfolded drawing of the support is generated dynamically alongside the steps, assisting in documentation and design evaluation.
