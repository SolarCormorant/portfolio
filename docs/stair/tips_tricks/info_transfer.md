## Document User Text

- Information from the UI, along with calculated values, is recorded to the Rhino file as document user text.
- This allows the data to be stored directly within the model, so it can be read and recalled in future sessionsâ€”enabling continuity across design iterations and simplifying version tracking.

## User Text

- Every item in the model carries detailed information, including weight, material, and cost.
- This enriches the geometry with meaningful data and supports a BIMesque workflow within the parametric environment, enabling informed, data-driven design decisions.

## Save Data

- Each design can be saved under specific projects and named subfolders, making it easy to organize, compare, and revisit design alternatives.
- Every saved model is also exported as a separate Rhino file, ensuring that both geometry and associated data are preserved for future access and development.
