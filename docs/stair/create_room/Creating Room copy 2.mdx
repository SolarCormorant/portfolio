## Personal Strengths

### Common Sense; 

- I know my strengths and weaknesses and I choose the hills I will die on very carefully.
- My approach to problem solving is first finding if that problem can be avoided and what are can be achieved if that problem is solved to see if it is worth to solve or should I just by-pass it.  
- I am the guy who points out where the plan might  fail so we can act accordingly and prepare for it. 
- I would think about why I am doing things rather than blindly doing it else it wont be different from the orangutan with the hammer and nail. She is doing every step right and probably in her eyes things are perfectly correct.  
- I constantly question my workflows and methods and always search for ways to improve them but I know when to think openly and tinker with and when to think close and get the work done.
- I can "smell the room" or "sense the energy" or "read people's faces"

### Recognizing patterns

- I do believe one of the things that makes humans different from other animals is the pattern recognition and it is how we learn from our mistakes or rather do not repeat our mistakes.
- I also think that not everyone should see the pattern I see nor claim the pattern I see is correct so I would like to record data on where we succeed, where we failed, where we stuck, talk about it without pointing fingers and visualize it so I can see if my argument is correct and pass that knowledge to others. 

## Personal Weaknesses

- Paralysis under unplanned stress. I am more of a *"I know what I will do today and I will do that today"* kind of person rather than *"this came this morning and we didn't tell you until now and we have to send it in 2 hours"* person

- I have very mild dyslexia. I cannot be trusted around numbers. I have to third check numbers and still might say one number and write different number. This was one of reasons why I did like the computational design in the first place because if I did made an hour ago in a digit I can always change it later and still have the end product. I also still need to think about half a second before deciding on which is right or left.  
## Personal Neutrals

- I am very detail oriented and I can chart the details, create workflows and focus on one detail at a time but I might skip details if I have to juggle way too many details in same time. One leg at a time. 
- I am a social person in small groups but I am not very keen on using social media including linkedin, promoting my work or any kind of interaction. I am a lurker when it comes to all kinds of social media. My latest post on instagram was in 2018. 
- I love helping people and teaching things I know but I wont flog a dead horse. 
- Money doesn't motivate me but lack of respect and money demotivates me
- If a well-trained monkey can do that task, it is not worth doing so find a way to automate it
## Personal Achievements

- Owner of 80's japanese city pop playlist in spotify with 435 saves. 
- % 0.3 listeners of the band ghost in 2023 and 0.2% in 2024 in spotify. 
- World record holder in mike tysons punch out opponent glass joe. 


## My Calling or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Change

- In my second year of university, I have read Adolf Loos’s _Ornament and Crime_ and I realized who is a "designer" and what personal qualities you need to have as a "designer" and I saw that i was not a aesthetics designer and I didn't had the qualities to be a aesthetics designer, so I embarked a mission to find my calling and what my design will base on. (Also my then girlfriend now wife had those qualities in person so it was easier to notice it)

- I planned to become detailed 3D model but our 3D modelling teacher said everyone can be a 3D modeller with enough experience but what you model is what makes you important or else you would be only using a tool rather than creating things. I wanted to create things.

- I did some coursework on architectural history on early Turkish Republic architecture and it was fun but it was not what was my calling. 

- I always knew my design should have based on something rather than "look how good looking this is" so my first breakthrough was learning I can say "the design is this way because it is most optimal in daylight aspect". 

- My second breakthrough one of my courses I needed to do a coarse optimization by hand trying to find optimal window to wall ratio in regards of heating and cooling loads. What was taught in design courses was your windows at the south facade should be big so there will be heat gain and your cooling loads will be lower. However the bigger the windows got heating load got bigger because of the heat loss out of the windows.  *cue glass shattering sound*

- Me and one of my friends wrote two conference papers and while I did the simulations, I saw how inefficient doing the cases by hand meanwhile heard a program called grasshopper where everything could be automated.

- I started to learn grasshopper in my 3rd grade, and many nights i learned grasshopper obsessively rather than doing my project work. There was not many tutorials back then about grasshopper or I tried to brute force my self to it and I still cherish the feeling of euphoria I felt in the moment I realized I can right click to a panel and make it multiline.   

- For my masters, building science program and computational design program's exam was on the same date and since grasshopper was "just a tool" for me and designing optimized buildings was my calling I entered building science program. In the program every building science program student thought I was a computational design student taking the class and vica versa. 

- thesis 

- After graduation I worked on building science but since every code was ready there were not a big challenge rather than explaining the simulation results since all the code already written.  

- So I knew i my calling was creating the tools rather than creating with tools.  

## Tools I Have Created

- In NJ Optimal I was working remote to Lithuania, my most promiscient work was the block (brick) laying tool which helped to model buildings with blocks make decisions design stage, based on structural calculations and most importantly create a billing table on how many palettes of block needed in the site and optimize the number of blocks used by replacing the unused ones. 
- In Konu Merdiven, I did create a algorithm to
