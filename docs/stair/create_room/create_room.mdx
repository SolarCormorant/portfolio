## Wall and Slab Properties

- Room dimensions and floor height directly influence the stair configuration, ensuring a precise fit within varying architectural conditions.

- Wall and slab thicknesses are fully customizable, allowing the stair to integrate seamlessly with surrounding structural elements.

- The room is generated automatically based on the UI inputs for ease of use. It can be hidden by collapsing the room expander or displayed in ghosted view for a clearer modeling experience.
## Custom Room

- When the custom room is selected, the walls can be manipulated by the curves either drawing new ones or modifiying the existing ones.
