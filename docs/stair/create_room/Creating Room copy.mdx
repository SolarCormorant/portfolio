title: About Me
---
I am an architect with a strong focus on computational design, building science, and workflow automation. My approach blends architectural thinking with digital tools—developing not just designs, but systems that solve real-world problems.

Early in my career, I realized that meaningful design should be based on logic and performance, not just aesthetics. This mindset led me to specialize in building data-driven workflows and custom tools—especially using platforms like Grasshopper and Python—to improve design quality, efficiency, and collaboration.

Some highlights:

Automated Block/Brick Tool: Developed a system for optimized building modeling, cost estimation, and materials tracking.

Stair Algorithm: Created parametric algorithms for stair design, balancing code requirements with practical construction needs.

I am detail-oriented, proactive about identifying risks, and committed to continuous improvement. I prefer to address root problems rather than surface symptoms, and I believe that automating routine work frees up time for meaningful innovation.

My strengths include critical thinking, pattern recognition, and practical problem-solving. I am motivated by respect, good collaboration, and building things that last.
