Step count is automatically calculated based on the floor height and predefined maximum and minimum riser heights. Step depth is dynamically adjusted within set limits.

In Type 1, depth adjustments affect landing size, larger step depths reduce landing areas.

In Type 2, depth adapts to the climb curve.

In Type 3, depth responds to the stairâ€™s overall geometry.
