## Custom Curves

- While stairs are typically generated based on predefined design options in the user interface, users can override these settings by manually editing the base curves or drawing a custom guide curve. However, if an option is changed in a way that affects the stairâ€™s shape, the geometry resets to the UI-defined values to maintain consistency and prevent mismanagement.

- This flexibility allows for the creation of unique stair shapes beyond the standard configurations, supporting more complex or project-specific design intentions.

## Guide Curve

- A guide curve can define the outer boundary of the staircase, enabling fully customized stair shapes while preserving full control through the UI.

## Gallery Curve

- Additional gallery supports can be added by simply drawing their projection lines.
